### üß©Components:

- ESP32 Development Board: Provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for remote control via mobile apps (Rainmaker) or other smart home interfaces.

- Light Sensor (Photodiode): Detects ambient light levels and adjusts the blind‚Äôs position automatically to optimize natural light or provide shade.

- Linear Potentiometer: Allows manual control of the blind‚Äôs position and motor speed.

- Capacitive Touch Sensor: Enables switching between manual and automatic modes with a simple touch.

- Dual Motor Driver (L298N): Controls motor direction and speed for smooth and efficient blind movement.

- DC Motor with Reducer and Encoder: Offers precise control over the blind‚Äôs position.

### ‚öôÔ∏èFunctions:

Manual Mode: Control through a potentiometer for precise adjustment of the blind‚Äôs position and motor speed or via the Rainmaker mobile app.

Automatic Mode: The system adjusts the blind‚Äôs position based on light sensor readings for optimal light entry.
